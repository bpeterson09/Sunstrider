# Sunstrider
This is a game I made that I desgined to be played on mobile devices with the Unity Engine. I am still working on implementing it, so for now it can be played on a computer. If you wish to play it, simply download both files and run Sunstrider.exe. Make sure they are both in the same place, and enjoy the game!

The ship automatically moves up and down, so you must press SPACE to move forward at the right time. This makes navigation difficult, so look ahead before you move!

If you want the source code, download the Sunstrider folder and open it in Unity. It will have all the code and images I made to create this game.
